# Preamble
I am not a professional academic writer, but I found that if you write things in
a prefessional way, it will not only make you think precisely, but also let you
do things differently and elegantly. That's why I started this repo, and one of
the most initiatives is that I want to make my documentation with a consistent
look and feel. 

I hate Markdown stylish, the rendered page to me always seems a little bit
casual, I'd like to be more serious on certain topics. 

# Why Orgmode and LaTeX
The `orgmode` is a double-edged blade, it is of more flexibiliby and customization
compared to `Markdown`, while `LaTeX` has tons of packages a beginner has to be
firstly familiar with. It does has a steep learning curve. But the generated PDF
format is fancy once you have learned more with these two powerful tools. 

This repo is highly inspired by the well know [SEED labs](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs), I was captivated by the
documentation of this project. I'd like to generate one for my own use, while I
find that people around might think it is useful. 

So I created this repo.
